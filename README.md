# Bootstrap Final Project Report
# https://github.com/coderdc13/nucamp_bootstrap_project  

## Preface
In general, this final report accomplishes three tasks: 1) documents the process of starting from an idea and reaching the conclusion of the project, 2) reflects lessons learned from the process in understanding what worked and what did not, and being able to make intelligent choices in the future based on the experience, and 3) shows what the student author (me, Franklin Bueno) managed to understand in terms of the design and development process through the project. This preface addresses directly, albeit briefly, the bullets in the objectives section of the prompt. In addition, this preface is followed by an introduction section, a design and implementation section, and a section for conclusions.

In terms of documenting the process of starting from an idea and reaching the conclusion of the project, the idea of the project came from the student author’s deep passion for Python in the contexts of a) artificial intelligence (AI), b) blockchain technology and development, and c) comprehensive data science. Thanks to Nucamp, the projects provided an excellent scaffold for sharing this passion in a logical structure. The conclusion of the project came from the logical end based on website organization and also the project scope.

For sharing the lessons learned from the process in understanding what worked and what did not, and being able to make intelligent choices in the future based on the experience, there were at least three lessons: a) it helps to have a logical structure, b) just like there is no such thing as a finished piece of writing, there is no such thing as a finished website, c) it was too hard to make a chat function. The student author would have taken forever and would have done a poor job on this project without the Nucamp website structure, even though the student author could be criticized for being too conservative in terms of website design. In addition, the student author was almost completely overwhelmed with details of modifications and bug repairs on the website. Furthermore, the student author was only able to make a placeholder on the top right-hand corners for the chat function.

In terms of demonstrating what the student author managed to understand in terms of the design and development process through the project, there were at least three key lessons. The first lesson is that the student author needs to make dramatic progress bridging the gaps between completing exercises and planning and producing a deliverable for stakeholders; the student author needs a better approach and more drills in terms of making a good website. In terms of the second lesson, the student author needs to improve in terms of project management, including time management and energy management. The third lesson is that the student author needs to improve in terms of dealing with unknowns, including coding obstacles, such as the lack of ability to implement the desired chat function.


## Introduction
The key feature of this project is the distribution of data in a logical and attractive format for the beginner. This project offers as its main focus a repository of data for starting to learn Python in the contexts of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and comprehensive data science. The student author made it a top priority to give links on each of the aforementioned topics. However, because of the nature of sharing information and the need for clarity, the student author also buttressed this top priority with a logical structure for this shared information. 

The student author started with one main page. This main page offered links to three ‘mini-homepages.’ The main page gives links in multiple areas (including the supporting image) to artificial intelligence. Also, the main page gives links in multiple areas (including the supporting image) to blockchain technology. In addition, the main page gives links in multiple areas (including the supporting image) to comprehensive data science. 

In this project, on each ‘mini-homepage,’ the student author provided the same format of shared information. In the body of the page, there are three sections. The top section gives links for background and introductory reading. In the middle, the second section gives links for video tutorials. The third and bottom section gives links for interactive coding.


## Design and Implementation
The design and implementation of this project closely followed the structure that was provided by the Nucamp bootstrap student workshops. The student-author may be criticized for following this structure too closely and for being too conservative. However, the design and structure of the website from the student workshops provided an excellent vehicle and example.

The transition from the intended design to the realization of the project in terms of implementing the code was smooth because of the close following of the given structure. Specifically for this project, the student author wished to provide a clear path for the information for learning the aforementioned topics. The student author was able to leverage the clean design from the workshops and present the information clearly from the given structure.

The student author made several design modifications. One major design modification was the change from Lobster font to Dancing Script font. Another modification was the increased number of images for design and entertainment purposes. Yet another modification was the presentation of the data (in this case, mostly links) directly on the page, but in sections.

Specifically for this project, the student author wanted to focus primarily on rendering the information in as graceful a manner as possible. The Nucamp lessons and Instructor offered wonderful background in bootstrap. As a result, the student author wanted to leverage the components that were taught in the classes and workshops. The student author planned, designed, and worked under the maxim of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”

## Conclusions
The student author learned mainly that there exists currenty a wide gap between his understanding of the material and leveraging that material in terms of providing a deliverable. In other words, the student author is extremely happy with his Nucamp experience and definitely happy with his assigned Instructor, and the student author is looking forward to the challenge of ‘being on the hook’ for a deliverable outside of this academic Nucamp setting. The student author also wishes to improve his project management skills, including in terms of marshaling resources. Also, the student author did not have many obstacles or bug repairs outside of the lack of ability to creat the chat function, and such challenges would have changed the approach to the project.

Some features were stronger than others. The student author is pleased with the direct presentation of the data and links. Also, the student author is pleased with the font and color scheme. The student author is pleased about the ability to make links from the images in the home page. However, the student author also notes points for improvement. The student author was unable to make a real chat function and had to settle for a placeholder button. Also, although the student author enjoys the color scheme, the student author would prefer a site that is in ‘dark mode.’ 

In hindsight, the student author would have done more research on implementing a chat function in the modal. Also, the student author would have changed the scheme to have light characters and letters on a very dark background. In addition, the student author would have experimented more with the size of the type for even more clarity, although the student author is pleased with the current results.
